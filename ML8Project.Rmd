## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readData}
setwd("D:/Data/Coursera/DataScience/8-Machine-Learning")
trainds <- read.csv(url("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"))
testds <- read.csv(url("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"))


```


```{r examineData}
#Does the data contain missing values
sum(is.na(trainds))

dim(trainds)
#str(trainds) 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
